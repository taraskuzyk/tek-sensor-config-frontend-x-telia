To run the project, clone it to your local directory. You will first have to run 

```
npm install
```

Once all the packages have been installed, find the *.env* file inside the root directory. Change the *REACT_APP_WS_URL* value to the 
URL of your server instance if you are running locally, or to "https://tek-sensor-backend.ngrok.io" if you would like to connect to the public version of the app.


After that, you can run
```
npm start
```
to start the app.

Enjoy!
